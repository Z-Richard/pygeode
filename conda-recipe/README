These files are needed to update the conda packages currently hosted 
on the aph42 anaconda channel.

Update meta.yaml.<release> to the git repository release number.

Copy 
  bld.bat
  build.sh
  meta.yaml.<release> --> meta.yaml

to a subdirectory somewhere called 'pygeode'.

create a clean conda environment including
  conda install conda-build anaconda-client

In order to automatically upload successfully build packages, 
  conda config --set anaconda_upload yes
  anaconda login

Then run 
  conda-build pygeode
  conda-build --python=2.7 pygeode

This needs to be done independently on linux, osx and windows since the package
includes compiled c-code, not only python sources.

The package can be tested by creating a new conda environment and running
  conda install pygeode -c aph42
